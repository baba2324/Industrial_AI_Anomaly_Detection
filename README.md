Industrial AI – Anomaly Detection Systems

## Overview
This repository contains industrial AI projects focused on anomaly detection in manufacturing environments, including image-based defect detection, time-series equipment monitoring, and industrial object detection.

The projects were developed based on anomaly detection methodologies from Brainworks, an AI startup recognized with a Grand Prize for its industrial AI technologies.  
The training program provided exposure to production-grade industrial AI workflows and real-world manufacturing anomaly detection architectures.
